				"description" : "I had the good fortune of mentoring Mahesh during his internship at Instoried. The thing I liked most about him was the minimal supervision he needed to accomplish his tasks. That, accompanied by his ability to read, comprehend, and quickly implement research papers proved to be very beneficial during our initial R&D stage for understanding Deep Learning based NLP / NLU algorithms. Finally, he has the initial sparks of an entrepreneurial spirit which proves to be very useful, as I found him to be invested in the business / strategy aspect of our company as well. Wishing him unlimited luck for whatever endeavour he chooses to pursue.",
